This is a README.md file.
My name is Uchenna Henry,
I am a graduate of Electronic Engineering from UNN.
I am currently learning Frontend Design courtesy of I4GXZuri.
I have experiences in Solar installation and Design as well Electrical and Electronic system(s) troubleshooting and repair,
I am also taking a python course on Udemy.
I'd be graduating from the Mckinsey Forward Advanced level soon.
Fun fact about me: I prefer inside to outside but I do not think I am an introvert!
